But, these word explanations had never been shared with the customers. Also, our customer service team used negative ratings to directly contact customers and get feedback. The measurement did not exactly match the construct we cared about because each individual has a different sense of what these numerical ratings mean. By giving a 4, someone might mean not good enough, while another might mean pretty good. Also, people who had a negative experience were probably more likely to avoid giving a rating altogether for various reasons, including social desirability and not being disturbed, skewing the ratings more to the positive side."

Then, another thing that I would do differently is to make sure that the surveys are sent to all the relevant stakeholders from top to bottom (top-level management to lower-level staff), depending on the relevance of each stakeholder with the specific project. In fact, some projects are considered more critical than the others, causing these projects to be also closely monitored by the top-level management, while some other projects are particularly just small projects which may not need any respondents from the top-level management."

However, standardization wouldn't necessarily end here because I would need to see if there were other factors that still caused discrepancies; one example we mentioned in class was regional/cultural discrepancies. To address the second problem, I would need to leverage the uncertainty quantification methods that we talked about during lecture 4, namely making assumptions on whether respond and opinion differences to quantify how far $\\hat{y}$ can be from $y$, because $y$ depends on a covariate that we don't know the population distribution of, namely whether or not there's a negative experience.\n"
